# Yelp_web_scraper
uses BeautifulSoup to scrape data on the top restaurants in an area

can easily be modified to your area. Either change the location names in the url or find the url yourself for your area and make it an f-string with {start}'

increase or decrease number of restaurants to review by adding or subtracting by 10 in the (max)range of for-loop

this will be modified in the future when i learn how to handle the UnicodeEncodeError's
